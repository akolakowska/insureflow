Minimum Premium for package policies is $350 (300,000 Liability), $500 (500,000 \\nLiability) and $750 (1,000,000 Liability). \\n \\n5.  All premium calculations shall be made by rounding the result to the nearest dollar amount. \\n \\n6.  Insurance to Value will be verified by using an industry recognized Cost Estimator. \\n \\n7.  One-year policies will be issued unless a different term is required for a specific purpose; \\ni.e., matching the term of a companion policy. \\n \\n8.

Those risks that have experienced losses in the past year may be declined or the \\ndeductible/coverages may be realigned to shape a more acceptable risk.  Review of prior \\nlosses is required.  The risk may be declined if exposures or loss history is unacceptable.  A \\nhigher deductible may be offered to mitigate smaller losses.  \\n \\n15.

Minimum Premium for package policies is $350 (300,000 Liability), $500 (500,000 \\nLiability) and $750 (1,000,000 Liability). \\n \\n5.  All premium calculations shall be made by rounding the result to the nearest dollar amount. \\n \\n6.  Insurance to Value will be verified by using an industry recognized Cost Estimator. \\n \\n7.  One-year policies will be issued unless a different term is required for a specific purpose; \\ni.e., matching the term of a companion policy. \\n \\n8.

Those risks that have experienced losses in the past year may be declined or the \\ndeductible/coverages may be realigned to shape a more acceptable risk.  Review of prior \\nlosses is required.  The risk may be declined if exposures or loss history is unacceptable.  A \\nhigher deductible may be offered to mitigate smaller losses.  \\n \\n15.

ISO Rating Rules and Forms shall be used in areas not specifically addressed in these \\nguidelines. \\n \\n2.  Building & Contents should be insured at least 80% to value for the coverage provided. \\n \\n3.  Minimum Premiums for property only coverage (no Liability Coverage) is $500.00. \\n \\n4.  Minimum Premium for package policies is $350 (300,000 Liability), $500 (500,000 \\nLiability) and $750 (1,000,000 Liability). \\n \\n5.  All premium calculations shall be made by rounding the result to the nearest dollar amount. \\n \\n6.  Insurance to Value will be verified by using an industry recognized Cost Estimator. \\n \\n7.  One-year policies will be issued unless a different term is required for a specific purpose; \\ni.e., matching the term of a companion policy. \\n \\n8.  Older buildings must have been maintained in good condition. A totally renovated building \\nwill carry the age of the renovation.  \\n \\nTotal renovation should include the major building systems such as plumbing, electrical, \\nheating, roofing, etc. \\n \\n9.  Properties insured by California Mutual should show above average maintenance and pride \\nof ownership. \\n \\n10.  As well as can be discerned by the insured, agent and company underwriter, all properties \\nshould meet all current building code requirements. \\n \\n11.  Property must be within Protection Classes 1-6.   \\n \\n12.  Buildings located in a brush area MUST be reviewed before being bound or issued. \\n \\n13.  Buildings in known landslide areas or areas with unstable soil conditions are not acceptable. \\n \\n14.  Those risks that have experienced losses in the past year may be declined or the \\ndeductible/coverages may be realigned to shape a more acceptable risk.  Review of prior \\nlosses is required.  The risk may be declined if exposures or loss history is unacceptable.  A \\nhigher deductible may be offered to mitigate smaller losses.  \\n \\n15.  Any risk that has been cancelled or non-renewed for non-payment of premium by prior \\ncarrier may not be considered for coverage unless mitigating circumstances are reviewed.\\n\\nDocument chunk 5:\\n15 \\n \\n4.
